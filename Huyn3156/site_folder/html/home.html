			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hi everyone, my name is Dan Huynh, I was born in Kirkland Washington where then moved to Lynnwood where currently I'm residing. I'm the youngest out of two, my sister being the oldest by only two years. Currently, here at Edmonds CC trying to get an Associate's in Computer Science before hopefully transferring to UW Seattle or UW Bothell to complete my education. Growing up I was always around technology, after my uncle immigrated from Vietnam in my early years of life, I've always seen him fiddle around with circuit boards, soldering, computers, and the list goes on. He started at an early age of 16-17 when he would do these things and as a kid, I was very intrigued by this.</p> <br><br>

			<h3>Interests</h3>
			<p>And even before then, I was very into gaming, I had a ds where I spent most of my time trying to beat Super Mario but then fail miserably. And an iPad where I spent most of my time on Youtube. It wasn't until about the middle school years I ever really owned my computer. As a kid, my Dad owned a computer of his own that he barely used and that I would use to play browser games all the time. Although, by the lack of performance in the PC I had at the time, still I managed to have as much fun was even possible with it playing lower-end graphic intensive games with my friends at the time, some including CSGO, Roblox, Minecraft, etc. Before I knew it, I had spent countless hours just sitting in a chair looking at a computer screen thinking about what it would be like as a career.</p>

			<h3>Interests Cont.</h3>
			<p>Like how I was as a kid, my burning passion for computers meets no end as far as I can see in my feature. The interest and thing that make me the happiest in life as of right now are, gaming, I've never once thought about quitting playing games. Watching Youtube, listen to Spotify and read web novels, and most recently played the new Pokemon Scarlet game. The path I see myself taking is more on the coding side of computer software and development. Web Development is a great skill to have and that's why I am taking these classes as a secondary plan if Computer Science doesn't work out. To me, the perspective on how you can use code to interact with objects around you seems endless unlike HTML.</p>
