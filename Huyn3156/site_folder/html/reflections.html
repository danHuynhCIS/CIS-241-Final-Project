			<li>From what I've learned from this class CIS 241 Web Development as someone who does not know anything to do with HTML5, I thought this class would be daunting. Going into this class I basically only learned how to use Python, early on I saw that only the structure of coding I got from Python could be applied to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It turns out everything was great, I loved the fact that this class was held at my own place and everything was given to me by the first day of the week so I can use that to set a schedule. I've definitely ran into some Aha moments during this class, one that stood out at the time was publishing a draft version of the Final Competency Project to Github. According to the documentation for the lesson on how to change the root of your page to main, it was different on Github because it seems like the page has been updated and the layout was different. And because of this I was looking long and hard for a section that matched the one on the documentation until I realized it was right in front of my face the whole time in another section called pages.</li>
			<li>Overall, I really enjoyed the time I spent in this class, the workload is balanced between the weeks, you learn very good examples of what you might do in the future. The textbook although it is a lot of reading, there are elements like mini quizzes, labs, and videos to allow for more user retention and allowed the textbook to be very bearable. CIS 242 is something I do see myself doing and I plan on doing it eventually since this class went so well for me.</li>
